SOFUN is designed in a modular fashion that allows for alternative process representations and levels of integration (see figure below) to be implemented within the same modelling framework. Its levels of integration are described below.

![](fig/sofun_modularframework.png)

*Above: Illustration of the modular hierarchy of integration. SOFUN can either be run mode **SPLASH** (simulating  evapotranspiration and the soil water balance, given precipitation), mode **P-model** (simulating ci:ca, light use efficiency and GPP, globally, given temperature, PAR, VPD, and CO$_2$), mode **C-model** (simulating the cycling of C in a grassland with fixed allocation), or mode **CN-model** (simulating the cycling of C and N in a grassland with flexible allocation). The P-model setup requires fAPAR to be prescribed, while the C-model and CN-model setups simulate LAI and fAPAR internally.*



## SPLASH
This setup simulates potential evapotranspiration (Priestly-Taylor equation) and the soil water balance (bucket model), given precipitation and cloud cover as inputs. The model is described in [Davis et al. (2107)](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/689/2017/). The photosyntetically active radiation calculated by SPLASH may be used to drive the P-model. Soil moisture calculated by SPLASH may be used for an empirical estimate of the reduction in light use efficiency in the P-model.

Compile and execute the model by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make splash
echo example_splash_sitescale | ./runsplash
```

An alternative implementation of the soil water balance follows the Simple Water Balance Model by [Orth et al. (2013)](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JHM-D-12-099.1), where runoff is generated before 100% water holding capacity is reached. This version can be compiled and executed by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make swbm
echo example_swbm_sitescale | ./runswbm
```


## P-model
This setup implements the P-model descrbed by [Prentice et al. (2013)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12211/abstract) and [Wang Han et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-017-0006-8?error=cookies_not_supported&code=878efd7b-d536-4a36-8b65-e24b054ba011). See also [P-model](https://stineb.github.io/pmodel.html). In combination with prescribed rates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, the P-model can be applied as a light use efficiency model for simulating ecosystem-level gross primary productivity.

Compile and execute for site-scale simulations by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make pmodel
echo example_sitescale | ./runpmodel
```

Compile and execute for global simulations by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make gpmodel
echo example_global | ./rungpmodel
```

## CN-model
This implements a fully integrated model for the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in a grassland (see [here](https://stineb.github.io/cnmodel.html)). Currently only implemented for site-scale simulations.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make cnmodel
echo example_sitescale | ./runcnmodel
```

## C-model
This implements the same components as the CN-model, but assumes a fixed allocation (root-to-shoot ratio) and does not close the N budget. It mimics a C-only model.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make cmodel
echo example_sitescale | ./runcmodel
```
