SOFUN is designed in a modular fashion that allows for alternative process representations and levels of integration (see figure below) to be implemented within the same modelling framework. Its levels of integration are described below.

![](fig/sofun_modularframework.png)

*Above: Illustration of the modular hierarchy of integration. SOFUN can either be run mode **SPLASH** (simulating  evapotranspiration and the soil water balance, given precipitation), mode **P-model** (simulating ci:ca, light use efficiency and GPP, globally, given temperature, PAR, VPD, and CO$_2$), mode **C-model** (simulating the cycling of C in a grassland with fixed allocation), or mode **CN-model** (simulating the cycling of C and N in a grassland with flexible allocation). The P-model setup requires fAPAR to be prescribed, while the C-model and CN-model setups simulate LAI and fAPAR internally.*

## Levels of integration

SOFUN can be executed at different levels of integration.

### SPLASH
This setup simulates potential evapotranspiration (Priestly-Taylor equation) and the soil water balance (bucket model), given precipitation and cloud cover as inputs. The model is described in [Davis et al. (2107)](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/689/2017/). The photosyntetically active radiation calculated by SPLASH may be used to drive the P-model. Soil moisture calculated by SPLASH may be used for an empirical estimate of the reduction in light use efficiency in the P-model.

Compile and execute the model by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make splash
echo example_splash_sitescale | ./runsplash
```

An alternative implementation of the soil water balance follows the Simple Water Balance Model by [Orth et al. (2013)](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JHM-D-12-099.1), where runoff is generated before 100% water holding capacity is reached. This version can be compiled and executed by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make swbm
echo example_swbm_sitescale | ./runswbm
```


### P-model
This setup implements the P-model descrbed by [Prentice et al. (2013)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12211/abstract) and [Wang Han et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-017-0006-8?error=cookies_not_supported&code=878efd7b-d536-4a36-8b65-e24b054ba011). See also [P-model](https://stineb.github.io/pmodel.html). In combination with prescribed rates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, the P-model can be applied as a light use efficiency model for simulating ecosystem-level gross primary productivity.

Compile and execute for site-scale simulations by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make pmodel
echo example_sitescale | ./runpmodel
```

Compile and execute for global simulations by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make gpmodel
echo example_global | ./rungpmodel
```

### CN-model
This implements a fully integrated model for the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in a grassland (see [here](https://stineb.github.io/cnmodel.html)). Currently only implemented for site-scale simulations.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make cnmodel
echo example_sitescale | ./runcnmodel
```

### C-model
This implements the same components as the CN-model, but assumes a fixed allocation (root-to-shoot ratio) and does not close the N budget. It mimics a C-only model.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
make cmodel
echo example_sitescale | ./runcmodel
```

## Setup for site-level simulations

### Summary of setup steps for site-level simulations:

  1. Get fAPAR forcing data (for P-model only)
  2. Get climate forcing data
  3. Get CO2 forcing data
  4. Get site and simulation parameter files
  5. Run SOFUN

Model forcing data is available on Imperial HPC's CX1 (`work/bstocker/data`) or can be downloaded or read from files using R scripts in repository [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin). All described below.

Here, we're preparing site-specific model forcing data. Each *simulation suite* (collection of sites that belong to a certain dataset, measurement campaign, or similar), has one meta information file which specifies (at minimum) the following information:

* `mysitename`: site ID, character
* `lon`: longitude of site, decimal
* `lat`: latitude of site, decimal
* `year_start`: start year of the simulation (for which data is available)
* `year_end`: end year of the simulation (for which data is available)

For certain simulation suites, meta information files are available from the repository [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin): `getin/metafiles_<simsuite>/siteinfo_<simsuite>_sofun.csv`. The meta information file the "centre-piece" that is used by several scripts that loop over sites in a given simulation suite. It may also be generated by the R script in repository getin `prepare_paramfils_<simsuite>.R`, available in repository [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin).

Here, we're using the FLUXNET 2015 dataset. Therefore, we're setting:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
simsuite = "fluxnet2015"
```

Forcing data is written into different subdirectories of `your_chosen_home/sofun/input_<simsuite>_sofun/`. Make sure this directory exists (here for simuite=`fluxnet2015`):
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd your_chosen_home
mkdir -p sofun/input_fluxnet2015_sofun
```

### 1. fAPAR Get forcing data

When executing the calibration on a local machine, download the data from CX1 or process new data.

#### Downloading from CX1 
Site-scale subsets from the MODIS FPAR MCD15A3H (Collection 6) data (4 days, 500 m) for all FLUXNET 2015 Tier 1 sites are available on Imperial HPC's CX1:
`work/bstocker/data/fapar_MODIS_FPAR_MCD15A3H_fluxnet2015_gee_subset/fapar_MODIS_FPAR_MCD15A3H_<sitename>_gee_subset.csv`

Download the entire directory `fapar_MODIS_FPAR_MCD15A3H_fluxnet2015_gee_subset` and place it in `your_chosen_home/data/`. Do not modify the directory and file name structure from `your_chosen_home/data/` downwards. Specify the path in the header of file XXX.

#### Processing new 
Downloading site-scale data from Google Earth Engine and interpolating to daily data is done using `gee_subset.py` from the repository [gee_subset](https://github.com/stineb/gee_subset) by Koen Hufkens and `get_sitesubset_gee.R` from the repository [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin). Gapfilling and interpolation to daily values is done by filtering based on the MODIS quality flags (see `gapfill_modis.R` from the repository [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin)) and applying a spline to daily values.

`your_chosen_home` is the path where you chose to place the repositories getin and gee_subset and the `data` and `sofun` directories.

**1. Clone gee_subset**

In your shell, do:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd your_chosen_home
git clone https://github.com/stineb/gee_subset 
```
Switch to branch `gee_stineb` by:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd your_chosen_home/gee_subset
git checkout gee_stineb
```
To execute `gee_subset.py`, you must have a Google Earth Enginge login and authenticate yourself. To set this up, follow steps described in `setup_steps.md`.

**2. Clone getin**

In your shell, do:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd your_chosen_home
git clone https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin
```
You must have a login on bitbucket and belong to the group 'labprentice' to get getin.

**3. Execute**

Change to the directory to where your local clone of the [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin) repository is located. In the header of the R script `get_sitesubset_gee.R` (see `MANUAL SETTINGS`), set then manual settings by hand, for example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## MANUAL SETTINGS
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
myhome               = "/alphadata01/bstocker/"
simsuite             = "fluxnet2015"
bundle               = "fapar"
overwrite_raw        = FALSE
overwrite_nice       = TRUE
do_plot_interpolated = TRUE
start_date           = "2000-01-01"
end_date             = "2017-11-27"
years_out            = 1980:2017   # creating SOFUN input data for these years
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
```

 Then execute it in R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("your_chosen_home/getin")
source("get_sitesubset_gee.R")
```


### 2. Get climate forcing data

Climate model forcing for site-scale simulations is extracted from site-specific meteo data and/or global fields (WATCH-WFDEI and CRU TS implemented), and written to CSV files containing all days of all simulation years, as well as annual ascii text files for each year. All files are stored in a pre-defined directory structure:

* CSV files: 
  `your_chosen_home/sofun/input_<simsuite>_sofun/sitedata/climate/<sitename>/clim_daily_<sitename>.csv`
* Annual ascii text files: 
  `your_chosen_home/sofun/input_<simsuite>_sofun/sitedata/climate/<sitename>/<year>/d<var>_<sitename>_<year>.txt`

`var` stands for the variable name (`temp`, `prec`, `vpd`, `ppfd`, [`netrad`]).

All climate data for FLUXNET 2015 simulations can be read from data distributed by the FLUXNET 2015 dataset. Download the full dataset from CX1 to your local machine (alternatively, run all the following scripts on CX1). The dataset with daily data is on CX1 under:
`/work/bstocker/data/FLUXNET-2015_Tier1`. Place this directory in `your_chosen_home/data/`.

Processing new climate input files is done using functionality from the repository [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin). Clone this repo as described above. In `get_climate2.R`, adjust the header manually. For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## MANUAL SETTINGS
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
myhome           = "/alphadata01/bstocker/"
simsuite         = "fluxnet2015"  
overwrite        = TRUE
overwrite_byst   = TRUE
in_ppfd          = TRUE
in_netrad        = FALSE
startyr_override = 2010
add_cru          = FALSE
add_watch        = FALSE
add_meteo        = TRUE
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Then execute it in R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("your_chosen_home/getin")
source("get_climate2.R")
```


### 3. Get CO2 forcing data

Execute the script that places a copy of the global CO2 time series in a separate directory for each site. Necessary like this - keeping it
flexible for cases where CO2 is manipulated per site/experiment. Adjust header:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## MANUAL SETTINGS
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
myhome           = "/alphadata01/bstocker/"
simsuite         = "fluxnet2015"  
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Then execute in R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("your_chosen_home/getin")
source("get_co2.R")
```


### 4. Get site and simulation parameter files

P-model simulations are done for each FLUXNET 2015 Tier 1 site separately, covering years for which data is available. After having prepared all the model forcing data by the steps described above, we now prepare the simulation and site parameter files. Here, we're conducting one simulation per site. 

Two types of paramter files have to be created:

1. **Site parameter files:** Define the geographical location, elevation and soil parameters (or soil type) for each site.
2. **Simulation parameter files:** Define the simulation start, and end years, number of spinup years, forcing data types, output variables, etc.

Both are created by `prepare_paramfils.R` available from the repository [getin](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/getin). In the header adjust manually:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## MANUAL SETTINGS
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
myhome           = "/alphadata01/bstocker/"
simsuite         = "fluxnet2015"  
overwrite        = TRUE
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## uncomment:
systr <- "''"    # for Mac
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Then run in R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("your_chosen_home/getin")
source("prepare_paramfils.R")
```

### 5. Get, compile and run SOFUN

The repository [sofun](https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/sofun) contains all the model code (Fortran 90) that implements the P-model and additional levels of model integration (water balance only, closed C, closed C and N cycles, see also [here](https://stineb.github.io)).

Clone the SOFUN repository and switch to branch pnmodel (XXX) using command line:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd your_chosen_home
git clone https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/sofun
cd sofun
git checkout pnmodel
```

Then, create soft links to input and parameter file directories by executing the Python script `linkdirs_sofun.py`. Before executing, specify the simulation suite inside this script manually:
```{py, eval=FALSE}
simsuite = 'fluxnet2015'
```

The following specification is required only for global simulations to link input fields (climate, fAPAR) to locations where data is read by SOFUN:
```{py, eval=FALSE}
dataroot = 'your_chosen_home/data/'
```

Then
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
python linkdirs_sofun.py
```

#### Compile SOFUN

Running the set of simulations for the suite `fluxnet2015` is done be simply executing the Python script (after setting manually: `simsuite = 'fluxnet2015'`):
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
python submitjobs_sofun.py
```

This executes the following basic statements that compile and run SOFUN:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
make pmodel
echo simulation_name | ./runpmodel
```
This setup compiles with the open-access GNU compiler for Fortran 90 gfortran and with the (non-open access) Portland Group Fortran Compiler.
