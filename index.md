# SOFUN model documentation

SOFUN is a modelling framework (Stocker et al., in prep.) that combines modules for simulating leaf N, light use efficiency and GPP3,29, litter and soil decomposition, N mineralisation and inorganic soil N dynamics34,35 and thereby accounts for feedbacks between plants and soil processes, including N losses, and is formulated based on costs of N acquisition. Above versus belowground C allocation is determined based on a functional balance approach, whereby CO2 fixation from photosynthesis (determined by leaf area) is in balance with N acquisition through roots (determined by root surface area) under the constraint of a C:N ratio required for new growth. The model captures growth responses to elevated CO2 and N fertilisation (Stocker et al., in prep. Unpublished results shown on http://bstocker.net/next-generation-global-vegetation-model/).
