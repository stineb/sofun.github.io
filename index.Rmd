# **SOFUN**

### *Model documentation* {style="padding-top: 0px;"}

SOFUN is a modelling framework (Stocker et al., in prep.) that combines modules for simulating leaf N, light use efficiency and GPP litter and soil decomposition, N mineralisation and inorganic soil N dynamics and thereby accounts for feedbacks between plants and soil processes, including N losses. It is formulated based on costs of N acquisition. Above versus belowground C allocation is determined based on a functional balance approach, whereby CO_2 fixation from photosynthesis (determined by leaf area) is in balance with N acquisition through roots (determined by root surface area) under the constraint of a C:N ratio required for new growth. The model captures growth responses to elevated CO_2 and N fertilisation (Stocker et al., in prep. Unpublished results shown on [my website](http://bstocker.net/next-generation-global-vegetation-model/)).
